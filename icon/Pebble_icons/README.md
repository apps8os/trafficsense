# Pebble UI Template

Hands-down the best Photoshop UI template for Pebble.

Includes all of the available built-in UI elements, a high-quality render of the watch body (including the new Pebble Steel), grids (by [Orviwan](http://forums.getpebble.com/profile/7316/orviwan)), and font information. And best of all, it's all done in vectors, which means you'll have no problems scaling this up to the size of a billboard.

Oh, and did I mention it's all available under the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en_US) license? Booyah.
